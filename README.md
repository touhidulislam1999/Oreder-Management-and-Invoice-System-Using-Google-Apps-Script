# Oreder-Management-and-Invoice-System-Using-Google-Apps-Script
This project is a Google Apps Script solution for automating order management, payment confirmation, and invoice generation. It integrates Google Forms, Sheets, and Drive to provide a streamlined, fully automated process for handling customer orders and generating invoices.

# Introduction
This project is a Google Apps Script-based automated response and invoice generation system. The workflow begins when a customer submits a Google Form. Upon submission, the system generates and sends a confirmation email with the order details to the customer. The form responses are stored in a Google Sheet. After payment confirmation, the system generates a PDF invoice, which is sent to the customer via email. This project streamlines order handling and invoice generation, eliminating manual processes and ensuring efficient communication with customers.

# Features:
1. Automated order summary email to customers upon submission.
2. Integration with Google Sheets for storing order data.
3. PDF invoice generation and email dispatch after payment confirmation.
4. Simple Google Apps Script integration with Google services (Forms, Sheets, Drive).
